# Progress: Streamlit GUI for Codebase-to-Tutorial AI

## 1. What Works
- **Project Re-Definition & Documentation Update**:
    - Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`) updated to reflect the goal of creating a Streamlit GUI for the "Codebase-to-Tutorial AI" script.
- **Initial Streamlit Application Created**:
    - `streamlit_app.py` has been created.
    - Includes UI elements for all `main.py` arguments.
    - Implements logic for command construction.
    - Uses `subprocess.Popen` for executing `main.py`.
    - Includes basic output streaming to a text area.
    - Includes functionality to ZIP and download the output directory upon successful execution.

## 2. What's Left to Build
- **Testing & Debugging**:
    - User to run and test `streamlit_app.py` with various inputs and scenarios.
    - Verify correct command construction for all argument combinations.
    - Verify robustness of output streaming and display.
    - Verify ZIP download functionality.
    - Identify and fix any bugs or unexpected behavior.
- **Refinements (Based on Testing)**:
    - Improve UI/UX if needed.
    - Enhance error handling or feedback.
- **`.clinerules` Update**:
    - Document any learned patterns or project-specific guidelines during and after development.
- **Finalize Documentation**: Ensure all Memory Bank files are accurate post-testing and refinement.

## 3. Current Status
- **Phase**: Initial Implementation & Awaiting Testing.
- **Overall Progress**: ~60% (Core application structure and features implemented; testing and refinement pending).

## 4. Known Issues
- **Output Streaming**: Displaying real-time output from a long-running subprocess in Streamlit can be challenging and will require careful implementation.
